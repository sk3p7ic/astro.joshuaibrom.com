## About

Fossil Finances is a web app tailored to the needs of senior citizens, providing them with a suite of financial tools that are
accessible and easy to use. The app was developed as part of the 2024 RowdyHacks SWIVEL challenge, which tasked participants
with creating a fintech application that would be useful to senior citizens. The app was developed by a team of 3, and I was
responsible for managing the communication between the frontend, Flask backend, and Firebase instance, as well as implementing
some state management and route handling in the frontend.

## Features

- Accessible, large buttons and text for easy use
- Texts are sent to the user's phone to show new purchases and other account transactions
- Resources are provided to help users learn about financial literacy and how to avoid common pitfalls

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- The frontend is built with React.
- TailwindCSS is used for styling.
- Firebase is used for user authentication and data storage.

### Backend

- A Flask backend is used to handle the sending of texts to the user's phone.
